# E-Commerce Customer Segmentation 

## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer data from an e-commerce platform to provide insights through a well-structured dashboard and an effective customer segmentation model. The goal is to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions regarding customer engagement, coupon strategies, and marketing efforts.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of multiple interrelated tables that contain essential customer, transaction, and business-related information:

1. **Customers Table:** Contains details about customers, including their unique IDs, join dates, cities, and genders.
2. **Genders Table:** Maps gender IDs to gender names (e.g., Male, Female).
3. **Cities Table:** Maps city IDs to city names.
4. **Transactions Table:** Stores transaction details such as transaction dates, coupon statuses (claimed/burnt), and branch information.
5. **Branches Table:** Links branch IDs to merchant IDs.
6. **Merchants Table:** Maps merchant IDs to merchant names.

## Project Requirements

### 1. Dashboard for Stakeholders
A dashboard was developed to visualize key insights, helping business managers and marketing teams understand customer behavior. The following visualizations were included:

- **Customer Demographics:** A breakdown of customers by gender and city using pie charts.
- **Coupon Usage Trends:** A time-series analysis of claimed vs. burnt coupons.
- **Top-performing Cities and Branches:** Bar charts highlighting the cities and branches with the highest number of successful coupon burns.
- **Customer Retention & Loyalty Analysis:** Histograms and line charts illustrating customer coupon usage frequency.

### 2. Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning
To better understand customer behavior, an unsupervised learning model was applied for customer segmentation. The steps included:

#### **Feature Selection & Preprocessing**
- Selected relevant features such as customer demographics (city, gender) and transaction behavior (coupon usage frequency, transaction status).
- Standardized the data using `StandardScaler` for optimal model performance.

#### **Model Development & Clustering**
- Applied **K-Means clustering** to segment customers.
- Used the **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Visualized customer segmentation using **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** for dimensionality reduction.

 ### **WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares) for Optimal Cluster Selection**
The WCSS was used to determine the optimal number of clusters for the K-Means algorithm. The steps followed were:

Calculate WCSS for different numbers of clusters: We calculated the WCSS for a range of cluster numbers (e.g., from 1 to 10).
Plot WCSS values: A plot was created showing the WCSS values on the y-axis and the number of clusters on the x-axis.
Find the "Elbow": The point where the rate of decrease in WCSS slows down significantly indicates the optimal number of clusters. This "elbow" point was used to select the best number of clusters for the segmentation.
The WCSS approach helped us avoid overfitting and underfitting, ensuring a well-balanced clustering solution

#### **Model Evaluation**
- **Silhouette Score:** Evaluated cluster cohesion and separation.
- **Inertia:** Used to determine clustering effectiveness.

#### **Segment Analysis & Recommendations**
- Analyzed each customer segment based on dominant city and gender distributions.
- Provided insights on which segments should receive more targeted coupons and promotions to enhance customer loyalty and engagement.

## Results & Insights
- The **dashboard** provided clear and actionable insights into customer distribution and transaction trends.
- The **segmentation model** successfully grouped customers based on behavioral patterns, allowing for targeted marketing strategies.
- Key recommendations included increasing promotions in high-engagement cities and personalizing offers based on customer segment characteristics.
